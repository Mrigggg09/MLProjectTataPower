# MLProjectTataPower
Internship Project at Tata Power

My code uses Deep Neural Networks to predict the healthiness and error type (if any) in the Power Plant. By assessing the various parameters that are required to be monitored in healthy & working Power Plant. 
It uses TensorFlow and trains on a on csv file we created on excel using various functions and applying what we learnt while we visited the field during our internship tenure, framing all the different parameters we noticed the engineers monitor 24*7.
